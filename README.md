# Beatrice V:


### **Beatrice V** is a **Functional-like, Object-Oriented and lightweight Robotics/AI framework**.

It is designed to run in low-spec CPUs, such as ARM-based Microcontrollers. To achieve this goal, **Beatrice V** is written using an over-engineered ideology.

> DISCLAIMER: Work In Progress.

**"GEAR YOUR WORKS"**
